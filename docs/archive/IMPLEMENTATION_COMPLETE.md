## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Orchestration Available Early
- **Day 12**: Airflow basics introduced
- **Day 13**: dbt basics introduced
- **Day 14**: First project using Airflow
- **Day 24**: Full production pipeline with Airflow + dbt + quality

### 2. Better Project Progression
| Project | Day | Uses Orchestration |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| CDC pipeline | 7 | No (learning basics) |
| Governed platform | 14 | ✅ Yes (Airflow basics) |
| Production pipeline | 24 | ✅ Yes (Airflow + dbt) |
| ML model | 32 | ✅ Yes (with feature store) |
| MLOps pipeline | 39 | ✅ Yes (full orchestration) |
| Prompting system | 47 | Optional |
| RAG system | 54 | ✅ Yes (orchestrated) |
| Capstone | 60 | ✅ Yes (everything) |

**Result**: 6/8 projects use orchestration (vs 1/8 before)

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage Added
- ✅ Airflow production patterns
- ✅ Airflow at scale (executors, monitoring)
- ✅ dbt deep dive (materializations, incremental)
- ✅ dbt advanced (macros, packages, snapshots)
- ✅ Data quality in production
- ✅ Data observability
- ✅ Testing strategies for data
- ✅ AWS Glue & Data Catalog
- ✅ AWS Kinesis & streaming

### 4. Logical Content Placement
- ✅ Feature stores moved to ML section (Day 25)
- ✅ AWS data services grouped together (Days 22-23)
- ✅ Orchestration before complex projects
- ✅ Quality checks integrated throughout
